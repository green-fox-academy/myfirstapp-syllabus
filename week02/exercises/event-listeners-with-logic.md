# Add some fun feature to your Event Listeners

## Exercise 1

- Add an input to your previous webpage
- Its default value should be *"blue"*
- When the user clicks on the last button
  - Read the desired color from the input
  - Change the buttons' background-color to the given color
- Try it with different colors

## Exercise 2 (Optional)

- Now your previous application changes the buttons' color whenever the input
  vale has changed and you clicked on the last button
- Change the behavior by ignoring all the clicks after the first one. So even if
  the input has changed, keep the previous color if it has already changed once.
